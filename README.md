# Summit!
A very low-tech skiing game being developed for the [Commander X16](http://commanderx16.com/X16/Ready.html) retrocomputer, written in C using the [cc65](https://cc65.github.io/) toolchain.  This will be similar to a game I wrote as a kid in BASIC and Assembly for the Commodore 64.

## Notes
- res directory -> png files used for sprites
- spritetests directory -> builds 'skier.prg' which demos the skier sprites
